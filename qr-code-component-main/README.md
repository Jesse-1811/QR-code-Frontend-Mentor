This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H)..

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt the extent of difference that padding, alignment and margins have on the components and how they interact with each other.

### Continued development

Id like to continue tackling more front end challenges to get more comfortable with prediciting how CSS properties interact with each other as I have been having difficulty with that. I'll do this by completing more challenges from front end mentor and also developing projects of my own.
